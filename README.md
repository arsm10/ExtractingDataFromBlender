# Extracting Data From Blender
Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality and computer games. Blender's features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing.</br></br>
In this project "Python Script" is used to extract ".bvh (Biovision Hierarchy file format)" file data. There are several motion file formats that encodes gesture and motion of human movement, .bvh is one of them. The .bvh (human motion data) in world coordinates and with the help of Python Script I can convert this data into 3D Image Coordinates. The Extracted data will get save in .csv/.txt file with Frame Number, Name, X, Y and Z. This extracted data would use for further such as Human Ergonomics analysis.</br></br>
.bvh files are downloaded from https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture/daz-friendly-release </br></br>
